Overview
========

What the code does
------------------
SÍGAME is a module written in python that can make synthetic observations of 
line emission in the far-infrared (FIR) of galaxies at any redshift. 
This site describes version 3 of the code, as presented in `Olsen et al 2021 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210202868O/abstract>`_. 
Input to the code is: A table of particle data for a 
galaxy taken from a cosmological simulation snapshot.
Output from the code is: A 3D datacube of line flux in spatial coordinates in kpc (x,y,z) as 
well as moment 0 maps along any of the three axes. 
By default, SÍGAME is set up to predict the following emission lines [CII]158, [NII] (122 and 205 microns), 
[OI] (63 microns), [OIII] (88 microns), CI (at 609 and 369 microns), CO(1-0), CO(2-1) and CO(3-2).


An example
----------
Below is an example of what SÍGAME can do. 
A simulated galaxy at z=0 is processed with SÍGAME to produce maps in three different FIR emission lines; 
the rotational CO(1-0) line, the fine-structure [CII]158 micron and the [OIII]88 micron line. 
The input galaxy to SÍGAME in this case came from the 25 Mpc/h volume box of the Simba suite of cosmological simulations 
[`Davé et al 2019 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.486.2827D/abstract>`_].
